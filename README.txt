The Khan Academy ([http://khanacademy.com]) is all about using video to explain the world. This application lets you browse and view the entire educational catalog on your Windows Phone device.

Or just navigate to *Marketplace > Books &  Reference > Reference*, or of course, just searching the marketplace for “Khan Academy”.

I’ve been extremely impressed with the quality and value of the videos since I discovered the site a few years ago. And it was no surprise when Bill Gates called Sal Khan [url:his favorite teacher|http://money.cnn.com/2010/08/23/technology/sal_khan_academy.fortune/index.htm].

I wanted a way to contribute to the cause, and with Microsoft’s new platform just launching, and the fact that I wanted a project to focus on for the Windows Phone it seemed a natural fit.

In keeping with the spirit of the Khan Academy’s [url:open source development ethos|http://sites.google.com/a/khanacademy.org/forge/for-developers/getting-started-with-the-code], I am making this project open source as well on CodePlex:
